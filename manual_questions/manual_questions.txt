1. Have you worked in Agile methodology? Explain it.

Yes, I have worked in Agile methodology. Agile is a software development approach that follows an iterative process, delivering small and incremental updates to the application.
Key principles of Agile include:

Scrum Frameworks: Agile is implemented using Scrum time-boxed sprints
Daily Stand-ups: Short meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and tasks for the day.
Sprint Planning & Retrospective: Before each sprint, tasks are planned; after completion, lessons are discussed.
Customer Collaboration: Regular feedback from stakeholders is crucial.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
2. What is software testing?
Answer: Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to verify it meets specified requirements and is free from defects

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

3. Explain the points you consider while writing a good test case.

Clear & Concise Description: Clearly define the purpose of the test case.
Preconditions: Mention any required setup.
Test Steps: Detailed steps for execution.
Expected Result: What the system should do.
Test Data: If needed, provide required input data.
Postconditions: Cleanup after test execution.
Traceability: Map test cases to requirements/user stories.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

4. What is the Bug Life Cycle?

The Bug Life Cycle includes the following states:

New → Bug is reported.
Assigned → Given to the developer.
Open → Developer starts analyzing.
Fixed → Developer fixes the issue.
Retest → Tester verifies the fix.
Verified → If fixed, tester marks it as verified.
Closed → If the bug is completely resolved.
Reopen → If the bug still exists.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

5. Difference between Test Scenario vs Test Case

Test Scenario								Test Case
High-level description of a test.			Step-by-step detailed instructions for testing.
Covers multiple test cases.					Specific to one aspect of functionality.
Example: "Verify login functionality."		Example: "Enter correct credentials and click Login."

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

6. Difference between Functional vs Non-Functional Testing

Functional Testing checks if the software functions as expected (e.g., login, registration).
Non-Functional Testing evaluates performance, security, and usability.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

7. Difference between Smoke and Sanity Testing?
Answer:
-> Smoke Testing(Build verification testing):
	verify that major functionalities of the application are working and the build is stable for further testing.
	performed after new build received to 
-> Sanity Testing(Bug fix verification testing):
	check that the specific functionality works correctly
	Performed after bug fix to 

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

8. What is STLC in software testing?

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) consists of:

Requirement Analysis
Test Planning
Test Case Development
Environment Setup
Test Execution
Test Closure

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

9. What is a Test Plan?
Answer: A test plan is a document that describes:
Testing objectives and scope
Test strategy and approach
Resources (people, tools, environment)
Schedule and milestones
Entry and exit criteria
Risks and mitigation
Deliverables and responsibilities

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

10.  What is Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)?
Answer: RTM is a document that maps requirements to test cases to ensure:
->Every requirement has at least one test case.
->Easy impact analysis when requirements change

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

11. What are entry and exit criteria in testing?
Answer:
Entry Criteria: Conditions that must be met to start testing (stable build,approved test plan, test environment ready, test data prepared).
Exit Criteria: Conditions to stop testing (all planned tests executed, critical defects fixed, acceptable defect levels, coverage goals met, closure report prepared).


*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

12. Difference between Alpha and Beta Testing.
Alpha Testing: Conducted in-house by testers before release.
Beta Testing: Conducted by end-users in a real environment before final release.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

13. How do you decide which test cases to automate?
High Regression Scenarios
Repetitive Test Cases
Data-Driven Scenarios
Critical Functionalities

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

14. Which test cases would you not automate?
Exploratory Testing
Tests with frequently changing UI
One-time execution cases

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

15. Is 100% automation possible?
No, 100% automation is not feasible because exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc tests require manual effort.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

16. What are important things to consider when logging a bug?
Clear Summary
Steps to Reproduce
Expected vs. Actual Results
Screenshots/Logs
Priority & Severity

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

17. Where do you write your test cases? In Excel or some other tool?
I use Azure DevOps for test management.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

18. Difference between Priority and Severity of a Bug with Example
Priority: Business urgency to fix(set by Product Owner -> Fix for go‑live release((UI issue on home page)).
Severity: Technical impact on the system(set by QA->App crash = high severity).

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

19. How Many Types of Testing?
Functional Testing: Unit, Integration, System, UAT.
Non-Functional Testing: Performance, Security, Usability.
Automation Testing: UI, API, Regression.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

20. Real-Time Scenario: If a bug is found on Friday, and the app is to be deployed Monday, what would you do?
Assess the impact: If critical, escalate immediately.
Work with developers to fix it over the weekend.
Perform targeted testing instead of full regression.
Seek approvals from stakeholders.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

21. What do you prefer, Manual or Automation Testing? Which is better for a team?
Both are essential. Manual is needed for exploratory, while automation speeds up regression.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

22. How do you pick test cases for Regression Testing?
High-risk areas
Frequently used functionalities
Recently fixed defects

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

23. Differentiate between verification and validation.
Answer:
Verification: Checks if the product is built right (process‑oriented). Examples: reviews,
walkthroughs, inspections.
Validation: Ensures the right product is built (product‑oriented). Examples: functional and
non‑functional testing.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

24. Difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)?
Answer:
QA: Process‑focused and proactive; aims to prevent defects by improving processes (reviews,
audits, standards).
QC: Product‑focused and reactive; aims to find defects in the actual product (testing,
inspections).
Simple view: QA prevents defects; QC finds defects.


*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

25. What are the different levels of testing?
Answer:
Unit Testing: Individual components or functions (usually by developers).
Integration Testing: Interactions between integrated modules.
System Testing: End‑to‑end testing of the complete system.
Acceptance Testing: Validation by users or clients (UAT).

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

26. Black box testing vs white box testing?
Answer:
Black box testing verifies software functionality without knowing internal code(Testers/QA), while white box testing validates internal code logic and structure with full knowledge of implementation.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

27. Regression Testing:
Regression testing verifies that recent code changes have not affected existing features of the application.
retesting:
verifies the specific bug fix by re-executing the failed test case.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

28. Testing Techniques:
1. Equivalence Partitioning (EP) - divide input data into valid and invalid groups (called partitions).just test one value from each group.
2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) - Tests at boundary values of input data.
3. Decision Table Testing(DTT) - Used when system behavior depends on multiple conditions.
4. State Transition Testing(STT) – test valid and invalid state changes.
5. Use Case Testing(UCT) – test scenarios based on user workflows.



EP Example:
Let’s say an input field accepts ages between 18 and 60.

Partition Type	Range	Test Case Example
Valid	18 to 60	30 ✅
Invalid	Less than 18	15 ❌
Invalid	Greater than 60	65 ❌

BVA Example (same age field: 18–60):
Condition	Value Tested
Lower Boundary	17 ❌, 18 ✅, 19 ✅
Upper Boundary	59 ✅, 60 ✅, 61 ❌
So, in BVA, you test just below, on, and just above the boundaries.

DTT Example: Loan Approval System
Loan approved only if:
Salary is high
Credit score is good

STT Example: ATM PIN Attempts
User enters correct PIN → access granted
3 wrong attempts → card blocked

UCT example - Login → Search → Add to cart → Payment → Order confirmation

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

29. Bug Leakage vs. Bug Release
Bug Leakage:
A bug that escaped testing and went live	
Bug Release:
A known bug that is intentionally released

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

30. Hotfix vs. Patch vs. Release
Term			Hotfix								Patch									Release
What is it?		A quick fix for a critical issue	A fix for known bugs (non-critical)		A full deployment with new features or fixes
Urgency			Very High							Medium									Planned
Target			Production (immediate)				Could be dev/test/prod					Typically staged or scheduled

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

31. what are the principles of testing?

1️. Testing shows presence of defects, not absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible - cannot test every possible input, combination, and scenario.
3. Early testing saves time and cost
4. Defect clustering - Most defects are found in a small number of modules(80/20 rule)
5. Pesticide paradox - some tests stop finding bugs over time(we must evolve tests for new builds)
6. Testing is context dependent - Testing approach depends on the type of application.
7. Absence of errors is a fallacy - Bug-free software is meaningless if requirements are wrong

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

32. Important testing metrics.
Answer:
Test case execution progress (planned vs executed)
Pass/Fail ratio
Defect density -  number of defects per unit size of softwar
Defect leakage - A bug that escaped testing and went live
Defect rejection ratio -  measures the percentage of defects reported by testers that are later rejected 
Test coverage (requirements, code, risk)

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

33. Common automation frameworks.
Answer:
Data‑Driven Framework – test data kept externally (Excel, CSV, DB).
Keyword‑Driven Framework – actions represented as keywords (click, type).
Hybrid Framework – combination of data‑ and keyword‑driven.
Page Object Model (POM) – each page represented by a class with locators and actions.
BDD Framework – uses Gherkin (Given‑When‑Then) with tools like Cucumber.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

34. What is Compatibility Testing?
Answer: It ensures the application behaves correctly across different environments: browsers, OS,
devices, and hardware configurations.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

35. Explain the Test Automation Pyramid.
Answer:
Base: Many unit tests (fast, cheap).
Middle: Fewer integration/service tests.
Top: Least number of UI/E2E tests (slow, expensive).

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

36. shift-left testing vs shift-right testing?
Answer:
Shift-left testing is the practice of performing testing earlier in the development lifecycle to detect defects as soon as possible.
Shift-right testing focuses on validating application behavior in real production environments after deployment.(Monitoring, feedback, performance)

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

37. What are test artefacts?
Answer:
Test artifacts are the documents and outputs created during testing, such as test plans, test cases, defect reports, and test reports, used to manage and track testing activities.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

38. 
🔹 Ad-hoc Testing:
Testing done randomly without any planning or documentation to find defects quickly.
🔹 Exploratory Testing:
Testing where learning, test design, and execution happen simultaneously.
🔹 Monkey Testing:
Testing by giving random inputs without any logic to see if system crashes.
